## 📖 About
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/), implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

My solutions are organized into daily folders. Each folder contains the notebook with the logic and the puzzle input (Note: Inputs are generally not committed to public repos to respect AoC copyright).

```text
├── Day 1/
│   ├── Day 1_code.ipynb   # Solution Notebook
│   └── input.txt          # Puzzle Input
├── Day 2/

├── Code notes.ipynb       # Scratchpad and helper notes
├── Notes                  # General text notes
└── README.md

## 💻 How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pymoon.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pymoon.git)
    cd pymoon
    ```

2.  **Install Jupyter (if not installed):**

    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

3.  **Launch the Notebooks:**
    You can open the folder in **VS Code** (recommended) or run:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

I am posting these solutions after I have solved them. I do not recommend copying code for the leaderboard, but you are welcome to learn from these solutions\!

### Recommendation on Input Files
I noticed you have `input.txt` inside your Day 1 folder. The creators of Advent of Code ask that you **do not share raw input files** publicly.

To fix this, you should create a `.gitignore` file in your root folder with the following content:

```text
# Ignore input files
input.txt
*.txt

# Ignore Jupyter Checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/
````

Would you like me to explain how to read the input files in Python if they aren't in the same folder (or if you decide to hide them)?
